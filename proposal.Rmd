# The problem

>  What problem do you want to solve? Why is it a problem? Who does it affect? What will solving the problem enable? This section should include a brief summary of existing work, such as R packages that may be relevant. If you are proposing a change to R itself, you must include a letter of support from a member of R core.

R is an amazing interpreted language, giving a flexible and agile foundation for data science. 
It is however sometimes slow. This is typically not a problem these days with the 
ubiquity of `Rcpp`, making it possible and relatively easy 
to connect R and a compiled language, namely C++. 

[Go](https://golang.org) is an open source programming language that makes it easy to 
build simple, reliable and efficient software. It is sometimes said to be the language 
C++ should have been, in particular if it did not carry a strong commitment to backwards
compatibility to C and a taste for complexity.  

`Go` is a beautiful and simple language. Its standard library is one of the most impressive
for a programming language. It comes with concurrency built in, which makes it trivial 
to write concurrent code, that includes (but is not limited to) running code in parallel. 

The static site generator [hugo](https://gohugo.io) and the containerization plaform 
[docker](https://www.docker.com/) are examples of systems that are built on go. 

There currently is no solution to easily connect R and go, i.e. invoke go code 
from R, and this is what this project is about. We want R packages to 
be able to leverage existing or original go code. We admittedly do not have 
specific use cases in mind, but at the same time it would have been impossible 
to imagine the importance of Rcpp when it was first developped. 

Having go as an alternative high performance language will open 
interesting avenues for R package developpment. [cgo](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/) gives us a 
C api we can use together with the R c api. [Prior work](https://purrple.cat/tags/go/) from 
Romain established that this a viable pursuit. 

# The plan

> How are you going to solve the problem? Include the concrete actions you will take and an estimated timeline. What are likely failure modes and how will you recover from them?
The Team: Who will work on the project. Briefly describe all participants, and the skills they will bring to the project.

The plan is to develop `ergo` as a *development time dependency* that facilitates the generation of 
code to interface R and go via their respective C apis. From the point of view of the user of `ergo`, 
the workflow will be:
 - write code in idiomatic go
 - call that code from R

The role of `ergo` is to hide the C layer entirely, so that users can focus on writing go and R code. 
In a way, this is similar to the feature of [Rcpp attributes](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcpp/vignettes/Rcpp-attributes.pdf)
but it goes further in that event though attributes generate code, but that code relies as Rcpp 
as a runtime dependency. We'd like to avoid that for a variety of reasons that are outside the scope of this document. 
Once `ergo` has generated the code, the target package is autonomous. 

The step zero will be to extend [prior work](https://purrple.cat/tags/go/) to validate 
the possibility of passing back and forth basic R objects (vectors, lists). Basic 
functionality includes ways to hand R vectors as go slices, and create R vectors from 
within go, which is essentially two sides of the same coin. Later on, we might 
rely on the new ALTREP features of R to implement synergy between go arrays and slices 
(i.e. things allocated and managed by go) and R vectors. 

Once we have enough confidence, we can move on to the first step. Automatic generation 
of boiler plate code to connect all basic R vector types and their associated 
scalar types. The [parser](https://golang.org/pkg/go/parser/) package for go 
gives us an abstract syntax tree of go code, we'll use that together with a set of 
conventions to drive the code generation. Rcpp uses the decoration (aka attribute) 
`[[Rcpp::export]]` to identify which functions to expose to the R side. Go has this 
(confusing at first, but so simple and powerful) convention that functions that start 
with capital letters are public and the rest are private to the package. We might expand 
on that in the context of exposing go functions to R. 

At that stage, the project will need community adoption. The second step will 
involve promotion and development of use cases that demonstrate the use of `ergo`, 
this will without doubt reveal needs we had not planned for, things like 
how I use this particular go package, how do I connect that particular R structure with go, ...

A dedicated blogdown/hugo powered site, will be use throughout the various phases of the 
project, perhaps with separate sections to isolate the technical 
issues and feedback related to the development of `ergo` itself, from use case 
material, perhaps featuring invited posts from the community. 

Initial feedback and casual twitter probing revealed that the R community 
seems to like the idea of an R and Go integration. We need to keep the 
community excited and on board. Lack of feedback from the community 
would have to be identified as a failure mode for the project. 

Go is currently not one of the languages supported by R, which might create friction 
down the line. In early phases of development, we can get away with 
having instructions about the tools needed to use `ergo` and the tools needed
to use packages that include code generated by `ergo`. But ultimately a 
package with go code should be as easy to install as any other R package. 
The third step of the plan will consider the distribution of such packages, 
can we use CRAN ? If not, what else ? Do we need code inside the base R distribution, 
i.e. something similar to `R CMD javareconf` to help mitigate these issues. 


# Team

[Romain François](https://twitter.com/romain_francois/) is co-author of Rcpp that now has more than 
1000 downstream dependencies, the experience of having written Rcpp is extremely valuable in the pursuit of
this project. Romain pioneered integration of Go into R in a series of 
blog post in the 2017 summer. He has more than 12 years professional of experience with R and 
a string commitment to open source development. 

[Kirill Müller](https://twitter.com/krlmlr) applied the techniques developed by Romain for 
successful completion of the “Joint profiling of R and native code” project, 
and successfully completed two rounds of the “DBI” series of projects. 
He has more than 20 years of software engineering experience, and has been an user 
of and contributor to the R ecosystem since 2012.

# Project Milestones

> Outline the milestones for development and how much funding will be required for each stage ( as payments will be ties to project milestone completion ). Each milestone should specify the work to be done and the expected outcomes, providing enough detail for the ISC to understand the scope of the project work.

# How Can the ISC help

> Please describe how you think the ISC can help. If you are looking for a cash grant include a detailed itemised budget and spending plan. We expect that most of the budget will be allocated for people, but we will consider funding travel, equipment and services, such as cloud computing resources with good justification. If you are seeking to start an ISC working group, then please describe the goals of the group and provide the name of the individual who will be committed to leading and managing the group’s activities. Also describe how you think the ISC can we help promote your project.

# Dissemination

> How will you ensure that your work is available to the widest number of people? Please specify the open source or creative commons license(s) will you use, how you will host your code so that others can contribute, and how you will publicise your work. We encourage you to plan content to be shared quarterly on the  R Consortium blog.
